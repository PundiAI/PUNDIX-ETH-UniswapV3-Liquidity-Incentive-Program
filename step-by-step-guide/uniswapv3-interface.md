# Step 1: Get token ID

> if you have your `TokenID` handy and are sure about which `pool` your token belongs to, you can skip directly to [step 4](nonfungiblepositionmanager-2.md).

1. In the [interface](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool), click on the `pools` tab to view the pools you have created or to create a new pool (by clicking on the `New Position` button)
2. In `Your positions` table, select the `PUNDIX/ETH (0.3%)` position to reveal more information about the position.

> If you have multiple `PUNDIX/ETH (0.3%)` positions, you may select as many positions as you want to be eligible for our incentives (all such positions will be entitled to our incentive reward).

2\. There is an `ID` on the `NFT`, this will be your TokenID

Add your `TokenID` to your checklist (this will be required later)
{% endhint %}
